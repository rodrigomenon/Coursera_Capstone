    "According to the [article](faturamento-mercadopet2019) by **Instituto Pet Brasil**, these numbers confirm the trend identified by the Institute: more and more people and families are looking for a pet for company, giving and receiving affection and attention. However, with the largest number of people living alone, and in smaller spaces, there is a clear growth for animals whose daily care is simpler, or that at least require less space. That is why this growth of felines occurs, especially in larger cities.\n",

    "Also according to the Institute, the largest concentration of cats in the country is in the states of São Paulo (21.6%), Rio de Janeiro (9.1%), Minas Gerais (7.2%) and Rio Grande do Sul (7.2%). In relation to dogs, there is a greater representation in the states of São Paulo (24.5%) and Minas Gerais (10.0%). The same occurs in the concentration of birds, it is also higher in these states. The highest concentration of fish occurs in São Paulo (47.1%), Santa Catarina (9.8%) and Minas Gerais (9%)."
